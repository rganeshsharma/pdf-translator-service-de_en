# Local PDF Translation with Layout Preservation

This comprehensive Python solution translates German PDF files to English entirely offline while preserving original formatting and layout. The approach combines PyMuPDF for text extraction and recreation, Hugging Face Transformers with MarianMT for high-quality offline translation, and sophisticated coordinate-based text replacement to maintain document structure.

## Core Architecture and Approach

The solution follows a **three-stage pipeline** that has proven most effective in real-world implementations: **extraction → translation → recreation**. PyMuPDF serves as both the extraction and recreation engine, providing precise coordinate data and font information needed for layout preservation. MarianMT models offer the best balance of translation quality and offline operation, with BLEU scores of 34.0+ for German-English translation while running entirely locally.

**Key technical advantages:**
- **Complete offline operation** with no external API dependencies
- **Sub-pixel coordinate precision** for exact text positioning
- **Font metadata preservation** including size, style, and color information
- **High-performance processing** suitable for documents with 50+ pages
- **Robust error handling** for text overflow and font substitution challenges
